FizzBuzz is a program which prints the numbers from 1 to 100 (inclusively), except for multiples of 3 and/or 5.
For the multiples:
- print "Fizz" if the number is a multiple of 3 (but not 5)
- print "Buzz" if the number is a multiple of 5 (but not 3)
- print "FizzBuzz" if the number is a multiple of 3 AND 5
