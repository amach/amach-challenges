Daily Programmer intermediate problem #16: http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/q8fqk/2272012_challenge_16_intermediate/

Simulate a craps game with the following rules:

Two dice are rolled to begin the game.
- If the first roll is 2, 3, or 12, the "shooter" (player) loses
- If the first roll is 7 or 11, the shooter wins
- Otherwise, the rolled number is the "point"
--- The shooter continues to roll until they roll the point (win) or a 7 (loss)

Calculate statistics such as:
- most common roll
- average winning percentage
- average number of rolls
